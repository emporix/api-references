        **Note**: params is not a name of query param. Any API model field can be taken as a filtering parameter.

        Filtering can be done by each field available in API. Filtering by multiple fields is also allowed. In that case, fields are aggregated with `AND` logic operator.
        * In a case of string values, the `contains` approach is taken (filtering by substrings). 
        * In a case of boolean and number fields, the `equals` approach is taken.

        Filtering query params examples:
        * `type=mass` - all units with `type` that contains `mass` are returned. For example, in that case all mass units will be returned.
        * `type=a` - all units with `type` that contains `a` are returned. For example, in that case all `mass` and `distance` units are returned.
        * `factor=1` - all units with `factor` that equals `1` are returned.
        * `baseUnit=true` - all units with `baseUnit` that equals `true` are returned.
        * `type=mass&name=gram` - all units with `type` that contains `mass` AND `name` that contains `gram` are returned. For example, in that case `kilogram`, `gram`, `decagram` units are returned.

        Filtering by localized fields:
        * Filtering by localized fields without language key is possible only when `Accept-Language` header with correct language is provided or when it is not set at all (in that case the default language is taken).
        For example, when `Accept-Language` is set to 'en', the request with parameter `name=meter` returns all units with `name` that contains `meter` in English. For example, in that case `meter`, `kilometer` and `millimeter` units are returned.

        * When `Accept-Language` header is set to `*` filtering by localized fields is possible only when fields contains a language key.
        For example, when `Accept-Language` is set to '*', the request with parameter `name.en=meter` returns all units with `name.en` that contains `meter` in English. For example, in that case `meter`, `kilometer` and `millimeter` units are returned.

        Fields to sort the response data by following order of the parameters from left to right.
        Can contain multiple fields in format: `field name`:`sort direction` separated by a comma.
        * The colon with `sort direction` parameter is redundant and descending order is taken only
        if it's equal to `desc` or `DESC`.
        * Ascending order is considered in any other case.
        Sorting by `name` parameter works properly only if the `Accept-Language` header is set to
        a specific language or is empty with default language specified in the configuration service.
