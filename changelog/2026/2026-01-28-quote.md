# 2026-01-28: Quote Service - restriction property for quotes

## Overview

The `Quote` object was extended with a new `restriction` property. This property is an access control identifier that determines who can
view or manage the quote.

The `restriction` field:

- Restricts quote visibility based on scope permissions
- Users can only query and view quotes whose `restriction` value matches one of their authorized restrictions
- Modifying requires special `restriction.restriction_manage` scope permission
