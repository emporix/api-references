# 2025-09-15: IAM Service â€“ Validation of predefined group assignments

## Overview

The IAM Service was updated with validation for assigning customers to predefined groups.  
This ensures consistent role management within a company (Legal Entity) and provides clearer error handling for invalid assignments.

New validation rules:
* A customer can only be assigned to one predefined group (for example *Admin*, *Buyer*, *Requester*) within the same Legal Entity.  
* Customers may still be assigned to different groups in different companies (Legal Entities).  
* The *Contact* group can always be assigned.
