# 2025-09-10: Customer Service - initial password for customer

## Overview

This update introduces support for initial passwords when creating customers. A new `password` field is now available during customer creation, allowing you to set an initial password for new customer accounts. Additionally, the login response now includes the `initialPassword` flag that indicates whether the customer logged in using their initial password, enabling you to prompt users to change their password on first login.
