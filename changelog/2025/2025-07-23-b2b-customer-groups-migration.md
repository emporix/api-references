# 2025-07-23: B2B Customer Groups - Migration

## Overview

We have completed an update to the customer group and assignment structure in the IAM service for all tenants. This change brings greater clarity and flexibility to how users are organized and managed within each legal entity.

## Whatâ€™s new

* For every legal entity, three new customer groups have been created: **Admin**, **Buyer**, and **Requester**.
* All users have been reassigned to the appropriate new groups based on their roles and legal entity relationships.
* Users without a specific legal entity have been assigned to a default customer group to ensure continued access.

These changes make it easier to manage user permissions and roles within your organization.
