# 2025-03-21: Site Settings Service - `timezone` field added

## Overview

The `timezone` field has been added to the `site.homeBase` request and response body. For now, this field is used by the Sequential ID Service to generate fallback values for placeholders such as:
- `__year__`
- `__month__`
- `__day__`
- `__hour__`
- `__minute__`
- `__second__`
