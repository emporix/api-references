# 2025-03-07: Order service - calculated prices

## Overview

The Order Service has transitioned to using new calculated price attributes at both order and entry levels. The following changes have been implemented:

* New mandatory attributes: `calculatedPrice` (order level), `calculatedPrice` and `calculatedUnitPrice` (entry level).
* Previously used price attributes (`totalPrice`, `unitPrice`) are now marked as deprecated and optional.
* Backward compatibility is maintained - the API will continue to work if deprecated price attributes are provided without the new calculated price attributes.

These changes streamline price handling while ensuring existing integrations continue to function without disruption.
