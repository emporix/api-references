# 2025-03-17: Order service - new endpoints to fetch orders for a legal entity

## Overview

New endpoints have been introduced to retrieve orders for a legal entity.
These endpoints allow fetching multiple orders or a specific order associated with a legal entity.
The response structure remains identical to the existing order retrieval endpoints for tenants and customer-managed orders.
