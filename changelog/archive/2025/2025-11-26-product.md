# 2025-11-26: Product Service – category and customer segment IDs in product response

{% hint style="warning" %}
This functionality is in preview mode — some of the features may not be fully operational yet.
{% endhint %}

## Overview

Product retrieval responses now expose two new fields:

- `customerSegmentIds` – IDs of customer segments assigned to the product.
- `categoryIds` – IDs of categories assigned to the product.

Both attributes are read-only, available only in product retrieval responses as they are populated automatically when category or customer segment assignment is created. Currently, they remain in preview mode as they are not fully operational yet.
