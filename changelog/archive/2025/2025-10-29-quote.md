## New features

### External prices
Prices can now be defined as `INTERNAL` - from Emporix Price Service, or `EXTERNAL` - as custom prices. The `type` field on price objects indicates the price type:
- `INTERNAL`: Price is fetched from the Emporix Price Service using `priceId`, which is a required value.
- `EXTERNAL`: Custom price is provided directly in the request, where `priceId` is not required.

### External products
Products can now be defined as `INTERNAL` - from Emporix Price Service, or `EXTERNAL` - as custom products. For external products:
- The `name` field can be provided as a localized map
- The `media` object can be provided with the `id`, `contentType`, and `url` fields

### Mixins support
Mixins and metadata can now be added to:
- Quote items
- Products within quote items
- Quote level (already supported)

PATCH operations support adding, replacing, and removing mixin values at all these levels.
