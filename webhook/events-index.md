**Learn about the `index.item-updated` event's specific behavior** 
#
The `index.item-updated` webhook event is emitted whenever there is a change on an item in the system - the index is updated with the new information. 
For the event to be triggered, a product must have at least one defined **price**, as it is the price that determines products indexing on a specific site.
Bear in mind all the events are site-specific, which means that they are linked to activities happening on particular sites. 
The prices are also site-specific, and a single price can be associated with multiple sites. 
The number of events triggered in the system depends on **the number of sites** assigned to a specific productâ€™s prices, with one event emitted per each site. 

Example:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>productid</b></td>
    <td><b>price with associated sites</b></td>
    <td><b>number of emitted events</b></td>
    <td><b>sites the event was emitted to</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>123</td>
    <td>$10 - sites A, B</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>A, B</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>234</td>
    <td>$10 - site A, $15 - sites A, B, C</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>A, B, C</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>345</td>
    <td>no price</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>none</td>
  </tr>
</table>

* A product *123* has one assigned price of *$10*, associated with two sites *A* and *B*. When you update the product *123*, the number of emitted `index.item-updated` events is **2** as there are two sites associated with the product price.

* A product *234* has two assigned prices: *$10* associated with site *A* and *$15* associated with site *A*, *B*, and *C*. So when you update the product *234*, the `index.item-updated` event runs **3** times, as there are three sites affected.

* A product *345* has no defined price. So when you update the *345* product, the `index.item-updated` is not emitted as no site is associated with the product.
