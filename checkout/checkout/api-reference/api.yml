        This endpoint initiates a checkout for a given cart or quote. The customer must be active while the checkout is in progress. Checkout is an atomic operation — it either succeeds or fails. If a checkout request fails, an appropriate validation message is returned. Depending on the issue, the checkout payload or cart content can be adjusted to meet the validation rules, and the request can then be retried.

         The checkout process performs the following operations:
         * Validates checkout
           * checks if cart data is provided
           * checks if customer data is provided
           * checks if only one payment method is provided
           * checks if customer mixin is compliant with the customer mixin schema
           * checks if customer address mixin is compliant with the address mixin schema
         * Validates cart data
           * checks if product prices are valid (is existing, has valid date range, quantity is valid for a wholesale price)
           * checks if the free shipping discount is properly applied (it fails when cart contains a free shipping coupon but the shipping calculation is not equal to zero)
           * checks if products in cart are valid (is existing, has a valid tax code) and still in stock
           * checks if used coupons are valid  
           * checks if the currency in the cart is the same as configured for the site 
           * checks if the selected delivery window capacity is valid
           * checks if the cart's delivery window has all required fields
         * Creates an order
         * Handles the payment
         * Closes the cart
