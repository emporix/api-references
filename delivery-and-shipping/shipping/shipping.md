# Shipping Service Tutorials


{% hint style="warning" %}

Names and/or descriptions of shipping zones, methods, and groups are localized. When creating a new shipping zone, method, or group, you can specify its name and/or description in one or multiple languages.

Looking for more info on localization? Check out [*Standard practices*](/content/standard-practices).

{% endhint %}

## How to configure delivery and shipping settings

To allow customers to place orders, you need to configure delivery and shipping settings by following the process below:

1. [Create a shipping zone](#create-a-shipping-zone).
2. [Create a shipping group](#create-a-shipping-group).
3. [Assign customers to a shipping group](#assign-customers-to-shipping-groups).
4. [Add shipping methods and define shipping fees](#add-shipping-methods-and-define-fees).
5. [Add delivery times](#add-delivery-times).
6. [Add delivery slots](#add-delivery-slots).

### Before you start

Ensure that you have created at least one customer.

{% hint style="warning" %}

A customer account can be created by the employee themselves or from your Emporix tenant's side. For more information, check out the following endpoints in the  Emporix API Reference:

* <nobr><Button to="/openapi/customer-customer/#operation/POST-customer-create-customer-account" size="small">Creating a new customer (customer-managed)</Button></nobr>
* <nobr><Button to="/openapi/customer-tenant/#operation/POST-customer-tenant-create-customer" size="small">Creating a new customer (tenant-managed)</Button></nobr>

{% endhint %}

### Create a shipping zone

Shipping zones are countries that your business delivers products to. You can create a shipping zone by calling the <nobr><Button to="/openapi/shipping/#operation/POST-shipping-create-shipping-zone" size="small">Creating a shipping zone</Button></nobr> endpoint.

<OpenApiTryIt
  definitionId="shipping"
  operationId="POST-shipping-create-shipping-zone"
  parameters={{
    header: {
        "Content-Language": "*"
    }
  }}
  defaultExample="Zone create payload with name as a Map"
  properties={{
    "shipTo":[
      {
         "country":"DE"
      }
   ],
   "name":{
      "en":"Germany",
      "de": "Deutschland"
   },
   "id":"germany",
   "default":true
  }}
/>

### Create a shipping group

You can set up shipping groups for customers and define different shipping methods and costs for these groups. To create a shipping group, you need to call the <nobr><Button to="/openapi/shipping/#operation/POST-shipping-create-shipping-group" size="small">Creating a shipping group</Button></nobr> endpoint.

<OpenApiTryIt
  definitionId="shipping"
  operationId="POST-shipping-create-shipping-group"

    "description": {
        "en": "This is the description for the group group1.",
        "de": "Dies ist die Beschreibung fÃ¼r die Gruppe group1."
  }
  }}
/>


### Assign customers to shipping groups

By adding customers to shipping groups, you can offer them different shipping methods and costs.
Assign customers to shipping groups by calling the <nobr><Button to="/openapi/shipping/#operation/POST-shipping-create-customer-group-relation" size="small">Creating a customer-group relation</Button></nobr> endpoint.

<OpenApiTryIt
  definitionId="shipping"
  operationId="POST-shipping-create-customer-group-relation"
  properties={{
    "customerId": "C001",
    "groupId": "group1"
  }}

## How to manage delivery and shipping information upon checkout

You need to retrieve available delivery windows to be able to estimate the delivery time for a specific postal code. At checkout, updating the cart with delivery and shipping information is necessary for the order to be placed.

1. [Retrieve available delivery windows](#retrieve-available-delivery-windows-for-a-particular-postal-code-and-cart).
2. [Add delivery information to the customer's cart](#update-the-cart-with-delivery-information).

### Before you start

1. Ensure that you have already finished the [*How to configure delivery and shipping settings*](#how-to-configure-delivery-and-shipping-settings) tutorial.
2. Ensure that you have created at least one customer.
3. Ensure that you have configured payment options. For more information on payments, check out [*How to enable payment methods*](/content/site-settings#how-to-enable-payment-methods).
4. Ensure that the order settings are configured. For more information, check out the [Order Service API Reference](/openapi/order/).

### Retrieve available delivery windows for a particular postal code and cart

Shipping times for particular postal codes are automatically calculated based on the business' shipping configuration, for example shipping capacity, or cut-off time.
Retrieve delivery windows by calling the <nobr><Button to="/openapi/shipping/#operation/GET-shipping-retrieve-customer-group-relations" size="small">Retrieving delivery windows by cart</Button></nobr> endpoint.

<OpenApiTryIt
  definitionId="shipping"
  operationId="GET-shipping-retrieve-customer-group-relations"
/>

### Update the cart with delivery information

Add the delivery information to the cart by calling the <nobr><Button to="/openapi/cart/#operation/PUT-cart-update-cart" size="small">Updating a cart</Button></nobr> endpoint.


<OpenApiTryIt
  definitionId="cart"
  operationId="PUT-cart-update-cart"
  properties={{
    "deliveryWindowId": "{{deliveryWindowId}}",
    "metadata": {
        "mixins": {
