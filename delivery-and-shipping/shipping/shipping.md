# How to configure delivery and shipping settings

To allow customers to place orders, you need to configure delivery and shipping settings by following the process below:

1. [Create a shipping zone](#create-a-shipping-zone).
2. [Create a shipping group](#create-a-shipping-group).
3. [Assign customers to a shipping group](#assign-customers-to-shipping-groups).
4. [Add shipping methods and define shipping fees](#add-shipping-methods-and-define-fees).
5. [Add delivery times](#add-delivery-times).

## Before you start

Ensure that you have created at least one customer.

# How to manage delivery and shipping information upon checkout

You need to retrieve available delivery windows to be able to estimate the delivery time for a specific postal code. At checkout, updating the cart with delivery and shipping information is necessary for the order to be placed.

1. [Retrieve available delivery windows](#retrieve-available-delivery-windows-for-a-particular-postal-code-and-cart).
2. [Add delivery information to the customer's cart](#update-the-cart-with-delivery-information).

## Before you start

1. Ensure that you have already finished the [*How to configure delivery and shipping settings*](#how-to-configure-delivery-and-shipping-settings) tutorial.
2. Ensure that you have created at least one customer.
3. Ensure that you have configured payment options. For more information on payments, check out [*How to enable payment methods*](/content/site-settings#how-to-enable-payment-methods).
4. Ensure that the order settings are configured. For more information, check out the [Order Service API Reference](/openapi/order/).

## Retrieve available delivery windows for a particular postal code and cart

Shipping times for particular postal codes are automatically calculated based on the business' shipping configuration, for example shipping capacity, or cut-off time.
Retrieve delivery windows by calling the <nobr><Button to="/openapi/shipping/#operation/GET-shipping-retrieve-customer-group-relations" size="small">Retrieving delivery windows by cart</Button></nobr> endpoint.
