**Learn about the `index.item-updated` event's specific behavior**

###

The `index.item-updated` webhook event is emitted whenever there is a change on an item in the system - the index is updated with the new information.\
For the event to be triggered, a product must have at least one defined **price**, as it is the price that determines products indexing on a specific site.\
Bear in mind all the events are site-specific, which means that they are linked to activities happening on particular sites.\
The prices are also site-specific, and a single price can be associated with multiple sites.\
The number of events triggered in the system depends on **the number of sites** assigned to a specific productâ€™s prices, with one event emitted per each site.

Example:
{% endhint %}

| productid | price with associated sites       | number of emitted events | sites the event was emitted to |
| --------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| 123       | $10 - sites A, B                  | 2                        | A, B                           |
| 234       | $10 - site A, $15 - sites A, B, C | 3                        | A, B, C                        |
| 345       | no price                          | 0                        | none                           |

{% hint style="info" %}
* A product _123_ has one assigned price of _$10_, associated with two sites _A_ and _B_. When you update the product _123_, the number of emitted `index.item-updated` events is **2** as there are two sites associated with the product price.
* A product _234_ has two assigned prices: _$10_ associated with site _A_ and _$15_ associated with site _A_, _B_, and _C_. So when you update the product _234_, the `index.item-updated` event runs **3** times, as there are three sites affected.
* A product _345_ has no defined price. So when you update the _345_ product, the `index.item-updated` is not emitted as no site is associated with the product.
