basic Emporix configuration needed to do a checkout on the new storefront.
3 parts

* configuration - payment, site, language, currency, tax, shipping zones & method etc  (this part can be moved to terraform)
* import (category, catalog, product, price) - this part is a project part related to data import/sync into Emporix
* customer (example customer with address)

 Maybe we can check the current quick start documentation if it has all the necessary configuration needed for a first checkout.This collection can be run on a brand new tenant and then Emporix Showcase checkout works.
