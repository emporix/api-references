## Identity providers

Emporix makes it possible to create standard customer tokens based on authentication provided by third-party identity providers. External identity providers can be used to offer users alternative ways of signing up, such as social login.

**Social login** is a single sign-on method that allows customers to authenticate themselves with an existing social media account. Introducing social login to your storefront simplifies the registration process by eliminating the need to manually create an account.
