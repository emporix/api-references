# Custom ID

Typically, the integration layer and ERP systems lack visibility into entity IDs generated by the Commerce Engine at the time of creation.
Emporix resolves this by enabling custom ID configurations for key entities.

Custom IDs bring significant value, especially for establishing relationships between entities. 
For example, associating a location with a company can rely entirely on ERP data and corresponding IDs, as the ERP system is regarded as the authoritative source for this information.

Custom IDs are case-sensitive. When they are autogenerated, the lowercase is used by default. If you want to create an entity with your own custom ID using uppercase characters, it is saved in that exact format. Consequently, when searching for the custom ID later, the same case format, including the uppercase, must be applied for successful retrieval.

If an entity supports Custom ID, it has it mentioned in the Key Feautres.
